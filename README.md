This python code simulates the Duffing oscillator, a damped driven harmonic oscillator in a double well potential.
It is a classic example of chaos theory, where the motion of the oscillator is strongly dependent on the initial conditions.
The code should take less than 5 seconds to run as is, and outputs the Poincare map, which is a fractal. More details are
found in duffing_oscillator.pdf.
